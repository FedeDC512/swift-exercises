 Imagine you are writing an app that will display a fun fortune (i.e. something like "You will soon find what you seek.") based on cards drawn. Write a function called `getFortune(cardSuit:)` that takes a parameter of type `Suit`. Inside the body of the function, write a switch statement based on the value of `cardSuit`. Print a different fortune for each `Suit` value. Call the function a few times, passing in different values for `cardSuit` each time.
